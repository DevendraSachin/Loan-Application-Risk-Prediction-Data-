Predicting Loan Success: Credit Insights for Smarter Decisions

### About Dataset
This dataset tells the story of people applying for loans in 2020, with some getting approved and others rejected. Many applied for loans to buy cars, start businesses, or handle emergencies. Full-time workers had better chances of getting loans, especially for smaller amounts. Some applicants, like a part-time worker who wanted $6,000 for a caravan, were lucky and got approved, while others, even with steady jobs, were rejected. The data shows how financial decisions affect peopleâ€™s plans and dreams.

The dataset includes:

loan_applications.csv: Sample loan applications with success/rejection labels.
credit_features_subset.csv: Credit file details associated with applicants.
loan_data_dictionary.csv: Data dictionary explaining feature columns.
